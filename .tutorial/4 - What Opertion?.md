# What operation?

Finding what operation the user desire is very important. The reason why is because this is the only piece of information that will tell us what we have to do with both of the numbers (no1 and no2).

## Finding what operation the User desire:
1. In order to find the calculation the User desires we have to first find the operation the user desires.
2. In order to find the operation, we have to give a list of operation characters our calculator accepts for operations. In order to do this, we can set up a simple print statement that tells the user of our accepted operations. Our four main operations are going to be: addition (a), subtraction (s), multiplication (m), and division (d). In order to put this in a print statement, all we have to do is inform the user about these operations in a string. To do this we do: print("The four main operations are addition (a), subtraction (s), multiplication (m), and division (d).")
3. Understand: This piece of code should be placed under the second input statement we wrote in the last chapter. Although the letters a, s, m, and d don't mean anything yet, they will me used for telling the computer what operation the user wants.
4. Modifications: The text inside the print statement can be modified if you want to present the same information. The letters a, s, m, and d can be changed if you want a specific character to represent a specific operation.
5. The next thing we have to do is ask for the operation the user wants to perform. We can do this by writing an input statement that stores operation requested by the user like this: op = input("Which operation would you like to perform: addition (a), subtraction (s), multiplication (m), division (d)?: ")
6. Understand: This input statement will take in either the value a, s, m, or d and store it into a variable 'op'. The colon and the space is to make the input location appear easier to the user. 
7. Your main.py file should look similar to <a href="https://github.com/testUser453/Build_A_Calculator_With_Python/blob/main/ForCreator(Don't_Edit!)/ExampleCode/3-ExWhatOperation%3F.py">this

Nice Work! You have successfully completed the 'What Operation?' chapter. Go ahead and move on to the next chapter: Performing Calculations
