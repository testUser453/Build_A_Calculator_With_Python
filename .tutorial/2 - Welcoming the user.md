# Welcoming the user:
On this page we will utilize the "print()" command in Python to give a one sentence description on what this program is about. These one sentence descriptions are what we call welcome statements. Welcome statements can be very helpful for the users running your code because they might give the user specific commands to get started.

An example is showed down below:

Input (in Main.py):                 
print(Welcome to my calculator program! This program was built in the Python programming language!")

Output (The following will be the output when the Run button is pressed):                         
Welcome to my calculator program! This program was built in the Python programming language!

## How do you welcome the user?

So, you've seen the example above, but how do we actually write a welcome message? In simple terms, we have to use the print() command built into python and make it take a string value using double quotes. 

### Let's try it ourselves:

Now that you understand what we have to do, let's do it!

1. In your <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xcrUdoYtVan2DLFm7IQLUMR7UCRNWrgE/view?usp=share_link">files tab </a> of this repl, click on the main.py file. This is the editor space where you will be coding in Python in order to create a functioning text based calculator.
2. In your main.py file, go ahead and type in print() on the first line of the editor space.
3. Next, in the parenthesis of the print() command, go ahead put in two double quotes. Your edited print command should look like this: print("")
4. Understand: The reason why our print command looks like this is because this shows that it is now ready to accept an input of a string in the double quotes so that it can print the string in the double quotes
5. After this, you can go ahead and type in any welcome message you would like in the double quotes. For example if I wanted to simply type in 'Hello' as my welcome message, my print statement would look like this: print("Hello")
6. Understand: A good welcome statement would introduce the user to the program. For example, a good welcome statement would be: Welcome to the simple calculator.
7. The final product should look similar to this
